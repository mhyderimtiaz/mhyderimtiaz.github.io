            I have over 2 years of experience as a software engineer, and have worked
            at startups. While I'm a proficient full-stack developer, my expertise is in building scalable front-end services (one page apps, websites, applications). I have also developed recent interest in Blockchain Technology.

           I love building things.
           While hard engineering problems are often intrinsically fun to tackle,
           I'm most attracted to solving real customer problems with a business justification.
           I'm looking for a senior individual contributor role where I can take on on collaborative team leadership responsibilites, and gain experience with
           architecture and project management.
